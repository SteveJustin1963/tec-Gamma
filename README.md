Hereâ€™s an outline for running a DIY gamma-ray spectrometry experiment using hardware and software:

### **1. Hardware Setup**

- **Scintillation Detector**: Use NaI(Tl) crystal coupled with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to detect gamma radiation.
- **Power Supply**: Build or purchase a high-voltage power supply to energize the PMT.
- **Signal Processing**: Connect the PMT output to a multichannel analyzer (MCA) for processing gamma-ray signals.
- **Pulse Shaping Circuit**: Build a circuit to filter and amplify the pulses generated by the detector.
- **Mounting and Shielding**: Use lead shielding to minimize background radiation and ensure the detector is stable.

### **2. Software Setup**

- **Theremino MCA Software**: Download and install this software for signal processing and gamma-ray spectrum visualization.
- **Calibration**: Use known radioactive sources like Potassium-40 for calibrating the system, adjusting the energy scale to match detected peaks.
- **Analysis**: Use the software to capture and analyze the gamma-ray spectrum from unknown samples.

### **3. Experiment Procedure**

- **Sample Preparation**: Place the radioactive sample near the detector within a lead shield.
- **Data Collection**: Run the MCA software to collect gamma spectra for a defined period.
- **Peak Identification**: Analyze the spectrum to identify energy peaks and match them to specific isotopes using reference data.
- **Documentation**: Record the spectra and any relevant data (e.g., sample type, distance from the detector, and environmental conditions).

### **4. Safety Precautions**

- **Radiation Safety**: Follow appropriate safety measures when handling radioactive materials.
- **Electrical Safety**: Ensure all high-voltage components are securely insulated.

This outline combines components from DIY Geiger counters, gamma-ray spectrometers, and software-based MCA tools for hobbyist-level radiation detection experiments.
